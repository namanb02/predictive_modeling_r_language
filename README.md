# Predictive Modeling with R Language

This repository is a collection of projects focused on data analysis and predictive modeling using the R programming language. Each project is self-contained and demonstrates key steps of a typical machine learning workflow, from exploratory data analysis to model training and evaluation.

The goal of this repository is to showcase practical R-based solutions for various classification and regression problems.

## Projects

### 1. Predict Milk Quality

This project, found in `predict_milk_quality.R`, focuses on building and evaluating machine learning models to classify the quality of milk based on several physicochemical properties. The project uses the `milknew.csv` dataset, which is included in the repository.

**Project Goal:**
To classify milk quality into one of three ordered categories: "low," "medium," or "high."

**Methodology & Key Steps:**
The R script follows a clear, step-by-step data science pipeline:

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing:** The `milknew.csv` dataset is loaded, and initial data exploration is performed. Key features are converted to the appropriate data types (`numeric` or `factor`), and the target variable, `Grade`, is treated as an ordered factor.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

   * A correlation matrix is computed and visualized as a heatmap using the `corrplot` library to understand the relationships between numerical features.

   * Mosaic plots are generated to visualize the relationship between key categorical features (e.g., `Turbidity`, `Fat`, `Odor`) and the milk `Grade`.

3. **Model Training and Evaluation:**

   * The dataset is split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.

   * Two different classification algorithms are implemented and compared:

     * **Decision Tree (`rpart`):** Both a basic decision tree and a cross-validated version are trained. The decision tree structure is visualized for interpretability.

     * **Naive Bayes (`klaR::NaiveBayes`):** A basic Naive Bayes model and a cross-validated version are also trained.

   * Each model's performance is evaluated using a confusion matrix to assess its predictive accuracy.

**Output:**
The script generates a PDF file named `Data101Project_output.pdf` containing all the visualizations created during the exploratory data analysis and model training steps.

## How to Run the Project

1. **Clone the repository:**

```

git clone [https://github.com/YourUsername/predictive\_modeling\_r\_language.git](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/YourUsername/predictive_modeling_r_language.git)
cd predictive\_modeling\_r\_language

```

2. **Install R dependencies:**
Open RStudio or your preferred R environment, and install the necessary libraries:

```

install.packages(c("rpart", "caret", "klaR", "rsample", "rpart.plot", "ggplot2", "corrplot"))

```

3. **Run the script:**
With the `milknew.csv` dataset and `predict_milk_quality.R` file in the same directory, you can run the script. It will generate a PDF file with the project's output.
